Unveiler is a Gemini based Chrome Extension to help digest website content more easily. Unveiler uses the Gemini API to summarize website content.

## Installation and Configuration Instructions

**Loading the Extension to Chrome**
1. Clone the Git Repo by clicking the green Code button, and then clicking Download Zip.
2. Extract the contents from the Zip folder. This folder contains the code for the extension to run.
3. To install the extension to Chrome, open Chrome, click the three dots on the top right corner of the screen, select extensions, and then click manage extensions.
4. On the top right corner of the website, there is a switch that says Developer Mode. If this switch is not already on, turn it on.
5. When you toggle this on, a set of buttons will appear to the left of the switch. Click Load Unpacked, and select the unveiler folder you downloaded earlier.
6. A puzzle piece icon will appear next to the address bar. When you click this, you will see the Unveiler extension.
7. Click the three dots next to the extension, and click 'Options'.
8. This will bring you to a page asking for your API key. Follow the next set of instructions to get an API key. 

**Acquiring Gemini API Key and Configuring the Extension**
1. To get a Gemini API key for the extension, go to the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey), and select the 'Get API Key' option on the left of the screen.
2. Select 'Create API key', then select 'Create API key in new project', and copy this key.
3. Go back to the Unveiler Options page, insert your API key, and click Save.
4. Now, when you would like to read a summary of a website, click the Unveiler extension, press summarize, and a summarization of the article will appear. It may take a couple seconds for the summarization to load, be patient.
5. After waiting a couple seconds, if the summarization still does not appear, there may be an error. You can troubleshoot by checking the errors log which can be found in the same page that was used to load the extension into Chrome.
